  description: "
    The QuickSuggest click ping is sent when the user clicks on the QuickSuggest link.
    It shares most of the fields as the QuickSuggest impression ping except that it doesnâ€™t include the user search query, nor the matched keywords.
    This data is kept for 30 days."

explore: +quicksuggest_impressions {
  description: "
    This impression ping is only sent on two conditions:
    A user completes the search session in the URL bar, i.e. he or she navigates away from the search bar, or
    a QuickSuggest link was shown in the URL bar at the end of the search session.
    This means that any QuickSuggest link(s) that was displayed while the user was still typing would not trigger this impression ping.
    The impression ping would only count the last QuickSuggest link if any when the search session ends.
    This data is kept for 30 days."
